# MiniTor

A mini client to interact with the Onion Router (Tor)

## Project Scope

We believe the most valuable learning experience would be to create a client for the system to which would allow us to solely focus on the protocol at hand. The protocol is well documented so we plan to create a client that will be built on top of a pre-existing SOCKS client for Proxy servers and build the Tor client on top of that. We could build a GUI, advanced client, and more but to make the project scope achievable, we plan on solely implementing an API with the same interface as the standard libraryâ€™s modules. We are planning on doing a Node.js implementation written in TypeScript as it provides type safety and well-documented / easy to use HTTP and SOCKS modules. An example usage of the project would look like:

```
import Tor from "minitor";

const url = "https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/";
const tor = new Tor();
const response = await tor.fetch(url);
```

Where response is the standard Node.js format from the standard library.
